## Introduction üöÄ

Obiwan is a state-of-the-art TFTP server engineered specifically for
PXE Boot environments. It is designed to serve as a modern and secure
replacement for legacy TFTP server implementations written in C. With
a focus on security, performance, and simplicity, Obiwan integrates
the powerful and memory-safe Rust language with the high-performance
asynchronous capabilities of the Tokio library.

## Features üåü

- **Read-Only**: Obiwan's mantra is safety. Tailored for PXE boot
  environments, it exclusively supports reading files to eliminate
  potential security loopholes and misconfigurations.

- **Security-First**: Obiwan takes advantage of Rust's memory safety and its minimalist design to substantially shrink the attack surface

- **OK Performance**: While staying simple, leveraging Tokio's
  asynchronous capabilities, Obiwan handles a plethora of concurrent
  file requests effortlessly.

- **No Configuration**: With sensible defaults, you just point it at a
  directory and off you go.

- **Free Software**: Obiwan thrives with your support and is open for
  contributions!
